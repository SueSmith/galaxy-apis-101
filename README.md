# Postman Galaxy - APIs 101 Training

[Import the template into Postman]() _tbc_

This project is designed to support Postman training sessions. The API returns learning content for display inside Postman using the Postman visualizer. The API is complemented with a Postman template designed to guide learners through the steps to reach learning outcomes for the session. The API is developed and deployed on [Glitch](https://glitch.com/~galaxy-apis-101) however you can deploy it somewhere else if you prefer.
